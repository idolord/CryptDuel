<p>You, brave soul, was once a mighty warrior. Numerous fables were written about your glorious battles. The combat that leads to your fall still bring fear, as do the name of the knight of death who defeated you.</p>
<p>In this world "spiritual energy" is the word that rule all being. Even if you have your own, soul geysers can provide additional source.</p>
<p>You have passed-out, but yet you are not alone. All your fallen people, still begging to serve your glory, cowering in the shadow of your Crytpe, are at your disposal, awaiting to get enough spiritual energy form you for combat.</p>
<p>But, beware, this is not all that there is ...</p>
<p>Every cycle, the grand "after" changes, new rooms, new opponent and still the same rule, war. War for spiritual energy. Spirits, summoning hordes of creatures, unleashing deadly spells, until there is only one left.</p>
<p>Maybe someone will someday discover where fallen spirit goes when defeated in the arena some come back, some ...</p>
<p>Another cycle is coming you should prepare for battle ready you troops, there is war ahead.</p>
